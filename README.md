# Railspedia
This is a functional clone of Expedia, a site where users search and book flights, built with Rails and styled with Bulma. My goal in creating this site was to learn more about passing data between views using controllers and selecting for certain data using model-defined functions and scopes. I also learned to seed my database by using Ruby functions, to generate thousands of flights for all of the different flight combos, rather than typing in data manually. I added mailer capability (for confirmation emails), but did not configure it to work with Heroku.
